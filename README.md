One of the interesting things about GitHub apart from code repository is the ability to follow developers and creators across the globe. This feature adds the network nature and structure for the GitHub.

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of the project is to study the networks and collaboration in GitHub for different types of Users. Upon a simple search, we can find a variety of technologies and roles of people involved with GitHub.

JavaScript and python have been used by web developers and machine learning developers respectively to be the highest. This conveys subtle information that GitHub is predominantly used by Web developers and Machine learning Developers. The goal is to study the Web and Machine learning developer network individually and combined.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
By analyzing different networks, the aim of the project is to understand and answer the following questions.
(1) Characteristics of Machine learning and Web developer Network.
(2) Most popular Developers in both networks.
(3) Collaboration among the developers in the networks
(4) Understand Why and how collaboration can be improved.
